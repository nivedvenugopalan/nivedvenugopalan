# Me 😎

Hey, I'm Nived a 15 year old student from India, currently (2023-24) in Grade 10 (My Current 🏫: [Palghat Lions School](https://palghatlionsschool.com/)). 

I absolutely love subjects that rack your brain like Physics, Chemistry, Math (you can probably deduce that I am a JEE aspirant too 🐤), and share an utter disregard and dislike towards Social and Languages 😢 (English is okay, but meh!). 

Programming has been a hobby, which started- about 4 years ago, along with my friends back in Qatar.
