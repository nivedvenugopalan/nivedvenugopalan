# About Me

Hello, I'm Nived, a 16-year-old student from India, currently in Grade 11 at [Chavara Public School](https://www.cps.ac.in).

I have a keen interest in intellectually stimulating subjects such as Physics and Mathematics, and I am a dedicated JEE aspirant.

Programming has been a passion of mine for the past six years, which I pursued alongside friends while residing in Qatar. I am currently developing a tool to analyze Instagram data, which you can explore [here](https://github.com/nivedvenugopalan/Instagram-Insights).
